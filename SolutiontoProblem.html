    <h2> Solution to Problem </h2> 
There hasn't been a solution to this problem yet. The U.S has set in Military forces and that hasn't done anything. With force the U.s won't solve anything. More terroists orginization will be created. My opinion, to solve the Isis problem is by creating relationships  between the U.S and other states.
